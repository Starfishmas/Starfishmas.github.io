<p class = "text">A demonstration of this program and its function is linked below. The creation of this project came with many difficulties including the introduction of color and the necessary changing of the space variable in order to account for these changes. In order to introduce color into the program, we utilized tried several color programs such as colorama, but we ultimately decided to use termcolor as it was more user friendly. Figuring out how to change the color of the X or O in the game took a little while but we figured it out. By changing the color of the X or O, the variables storing the space became changed so the win condition needed to be changed to account for the edited variable. I designed the game board and implemented the color independently into this project.</p>
