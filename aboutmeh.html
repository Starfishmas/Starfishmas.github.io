<p1 class="text">Sound design is my passion. I a striving to grow my knowlege of sound design in order to eventually be able to pursue a career in an occupation relating to this. I am currently working as a sound designer at my high school and working on getting certified by audio techology company shure as an audio technician. I've been working with audio equipment since my middle school asked me to run the audio for our school events and I have enjoyed it ever since.
<br>
<p1 class="text">In my work, people describe me as methodical, resourceful, and patient which I think fits well with the technical career I am aiming for. In my education, I find myself often described as quick-learner and very persisitent towards working towards my academic goals. I have been acknowleged for my work on various theatrical works and in school I hold an above average gpa and passed multiple college level classes.
<br>
<p1 class="text">I have worked in various places throughout my lifetime and working in each one has taught me valuable lessons on how to better myself and my education. I have done secretary work for a sheetmetal manufacturing company and learned the importance of organization and structured documentation. From working in theatre companies, I have learned the importance of checking cues multiple times and I have become better at adapting to situations in which something has gone wrong and how to fix it skillfully and cleanly.
<br>
<p1 class="text">If you have read this far, thank you for taking an intrest in me and the various projects that are displayed here. All in all I wish to broaden my horizons as I continue to grow and experiment with various different technical carrer options and as such I'd like to invite you continue exploring the rest of my website and check out my various projects.
